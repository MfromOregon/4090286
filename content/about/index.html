<h2>A timeline on my love of science, math, and things I don’t understand</h2>
<p><strong>1. Physics, a hobby?</strong></p>
<p>It started in 10th grade when I became obsessed with quantum physics. Only to the extent that I loved how hard it made my brain work and how my mind was constantly blown. So long story short there was/is like no money, job growth or security in theoretical/astro/experimental/quantum physics.</p>
<p><strong>2. My love of research</strong></p>
<p>I moved to Portland for the Social Work program at PSU, then realized it wasn’t aligning to my stress capabilities. So I took it up a notch and transferred to the pre-med Naturopathic Medicine program and felt really out of place. Then I reflected on what part of “doctor” I wanted, which was to work in research, policy, and anything more so behind the scenes.</p>
<p><strong>The Shrek to my Fiona</strong></p>
<p>Well my adviser was pretty blunt and told me getting a PhD is essentially not fitting for me. Not in a bad way, but I (was) a single mom with a high-needs child, dealing with health issues myself, and so on and so forth so she introduced me to the word <strong><em>b i o s t a t i s t i c s</em></strong> and it was like I had found my career-soulmate.</p>
<p>I would like to dedicate my remaining brainpower and ever-growing passion to the creators of <a href="https://bookdown.org/">Bookdown</a>, probably the best free resource ever.</p>
