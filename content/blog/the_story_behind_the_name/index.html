<p><em>“It’s Just Calculus”</em> is an overused inside-joke that I have with myself, my 4 year old, partner and my two pups. I run jokes into the ground to where they are no longer funny, so if you see this phrase in an ill-fitting section throughout this site, this is why.</p>
<p>This story begins with a TA who was struggling with the power he held as grader and feedback provider and would critique the hell out of my <em>introductory</em> biostatistics assignments.</p>
<p>In one of his feedback sections, regarding what type of calculation I used or maybe what sort of graph I created <em>whatever the case</em> he wrote…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>it’s just calculus</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>…implying that calculus is easy and <em>duh of course, it’s just calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Long story not-so-short, it was one of the best laughs I’ve ever had and I’ve ran this joke into the ground so hard and there’s no end in sight, so I dedicated my firstwebsite to this.</p>
<p>Below is the first biostats-related meme I’ve made, to which I had sent to my professors after nearly receiving a negative grade (this is why standardized and timed testing needs to end but I will save that for another time). It was a massive learning curve and I believe a lot of positivity has came from an almost negative grade. They did enjoy this handcrafted meme though. :)</p>
