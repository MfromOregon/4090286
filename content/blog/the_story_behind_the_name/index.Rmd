*"It's Just Calculus"* is an overused inside-joke that I have with myself, my 4 year old, partner and my two pups. I run jokes into the ground to where they are no longer funny, so if you see this phrase in an ill-fitting section throughout this site, this is why.

This story begins with a TA who was struggling with the power he held as grader and feedback provider and would critique the hell out of my *introductory* biostatistics assignments.

In one of his feedback sections, regarding what type of calculation I used or maybe what sort of graph I created *whatever the case* he wrote...

> ***it's just calculus***  

...implying that calculus is easy and *duh of course, it's just calculus*.  
  
Long story not-so-short, it was one of the best laughs I've ever had and I've ran this joke into the ground so hard and there's no end in sight, so I dedicated my firstwebsite to this.  
  
Below is the first biostats-related meme I've made, to which I had sent to my professors after nearly receiving a negative grade (this is why standardized and timed testing needs to end but I will save that for another time). It was a massive learning curve and I believe a lot of positivity has came from an almost negative grade. They did enjoy this handcrafted meme though. :)
