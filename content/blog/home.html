<h3>Welcome fellow data nerds, current and prospective.</h3>
<p>My name is Saffron H. Evergreen (pronouns: they/she) and I am a graduate student in the MPH Biostatistics program at OHSU-PSU. I received my B.S. in Public Health: Health Services Administration in 2021 through the School of Public Health at OHSU-PSU.<br />
While building my skills and data analysis portfolio, I prefer to dive into research pertaining to rare genetic disorders, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, neurodiversity, disability rights, the history of eugenics, the industrial prison system and -to prevent severe burnout- I like to attempt fun data projects (i.e., “Did Death/Black Metal Really Impact the Spread of the Satanic Panic in the 80’s and 90’s?”… stay tuned).</p>
<p>Currently, I am a student, a mom to 1 child and 2 dogs, a partner and trying to navigate academia and the workforce as a disabled person with a disabled family.</p>
<p>Outside of work-school-things, I like to go to the beach, hike… “hike”, forage forest wreaths and/or bouquets, watch horror movies and documentaries, do stick n poke tattoos and go thrifting.</p>
<p>Find me at <em>insert linkedin and github stuff here</em>.</p>
<p><em>“It’s Just Calculus”</em> is an overused inside-joke that I have with myself, my 4 year old, partner and my two pups.</p>
<p>This story begins with a TA who was struggling with his ego a bit and would critique the hell out of my Intro to Biostatistics assignments and tell me things I was supposed to know despite never learning it in class.</p>
<p>Quick gist - in one of his feedback sections, regarding what type of calculation I used or maybe what sort of graph I created <em>whatever the case</em> he wrote…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>it’s just calculus</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>…implying that calculus is easy and <em>duh of course, it’s just calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless it was one of the best laughs I’ve ever had and I’ve ran this joke into the ground so hard and there’s no end in sight that I’ve dedicated my website to this.</p>
<p>This is the first biostats-related meme I’ve made, to which I had sent to the professors and TA after nearly receiving a negative grade (this is why standardized and timed testing needs to end but I will save that for another time). They did enjoy this handcrafted meme though. :)</p>
