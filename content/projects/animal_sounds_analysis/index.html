<p>This was lab 3</p>
<div id="add-dataset-here" class="section level1">
<h1>add dataset here</h1>
<p>This was the code I used to produce a scatterplot that shows at what ages the children in this study were able to make specific animal noises - faceted by the animal sounds.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>scatterplot_sounds &lt;- ggplot(sounds, aes(x = age, 
  y = prop_produce)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = &quot;Age (months)&quot;, 
    y = &quot;Proportion of Children Producing&quot;) +
  facet_wrap(~sound)</code></pre>
<p>This is the code for a line graph that is color coded by animal sounds, not faceted.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>line_plot_sounds &lt;- ggplot(sounds, aes(
  x = age, 
  y = prop_produce)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = sound)) + 
  # geom_line is grouped by sound, meaning the lines will connect to each sound group point (3 different line plots vs 1 fully connected line plot)
  geom_point(aes(color = sound), size = 2) + 
  # geom_point also grouped by color by sound
  labs(x = &quot;Age (months)&quot;, 
       y = &quot;Proportion of Children Producing&quot;) 

line_plot_sounds</code></pre>
</div>
