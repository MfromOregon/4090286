<h3>Welcome fellow data nerds, current and prospective.</h3>
<p>My name is Saffron H. Evergreen (pronouns: they/she) and I am a graduate student in the MPH Biostatistics program at OHSU-PSU. I received my B.S. in Public Health: Health Services Administration in 2021 through the School of Public Health at OHSU-PSU.<br />
While building my skills and data analysis portfolio, I prefer to dive into research pertaining to rare genetic disorders, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, neurodiversity, disability rights, the history of eugenics, the industrial prison system and -to prevent severe burnout- I like to attempt fun data projects (i.e., “Did Death/Black Metal Really Impact the Spread of the Satanic Panic in the 80’s and 90’s?”… stay tuned).</p>
<p>Currently, I am a student, a mom to 1 child and 2 dogs, a partner and trying to navigate academia and the workforce as a disabled person with a disabled family.</p>
<p>Outside of work-school-things, I like to go to the beach, hike… “hike”, forage forest wreaths and/or bouquets, watch horror movies and documentaries, do stick n poke tattoos and go thrifting.</p>
<p>Find me at [[<em>insert linkedin and github stuff here</em>]].<br />
(This will happen eventually)</p>
