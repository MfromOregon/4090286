<h4>Graph Explanation:</h4>
<p>I had made this graph to compare the surface area of paintings in MoMA by female and male artists. The idea behind this was that I wanted to see if “females” generally produced smaller art compared to “males.” Since misogynistic views often are aligned with the idea that women need to make themselves small and dainty, and not to be “too showy” - my thoughts were that there would be a lot of small “female” paintings and larger “male” paintings.</p>
<p>At a very generalized level, it does look like this might be the case; that female artists produce smaller paintings than male artists.</p>
