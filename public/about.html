<h3>How my relationship with biostatistics developed</h3>
<div id="physics-not-classical" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Physics, not classical</em></h4>
<p>It started in 10th grade when I became obsessed with quantum physics. Only to the extent that I loved how hard it made my brain work and how my mind was constantly blown. So long story short there was/is like no money, job growth or security in theoretical/astro/experimental/quantum physics.</p>

<h4><em>My love of research</em></h4>
<p>I moved to Portland for the Social Work program at PSU, then realized it wasn’t aligning to my stress capabilities. So I took it up a notch and transferred to the pre-med Naturopathic Medicine program and felt <em>really</em> out of place. Then I reflected on what part of “doctor” I wanted, which was to work in research, policy, and anything more so behind the scenes.</p>

<h4><em>The Shrek to my Fiona</em></h4>
<p>Well my adviser was pretty blunt and told me getting a PhD is essentially not fitting for me. Not in a bad way, but I (was) a single mom with a high-needs child, dealing with health issues myself, and so on and so forth so she introduced me to the word <strong><em>b i o s t a t i s t i c s</em></strong> and it was like I had found my career-soulmate.</p>
<p>Due to my mystery diagnosis and being in year 3 of a highly-politicized and polarizing pandemic, I’ve grown even more interested in clinical research and have gotten over my fear of epidemiology.</p>

<div id="what-is-fueling-my-brain-at-the-moment" class="section level4">
<h4><em>What is fueling my brain at the moment ~</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>clinical research: research transparency, accessibility, readability</em></li>
<li><em>(epi)genetics, anti-eugenics, rare disorders, autoimmune diseases, connective tissue diseases</em></li>
<li><em>neurodiversity, gender, sexuality, social dynamics</em></li>
<li><em>learning more about the accuracy on the things we rely too much on (labs, imaging, etc)</em></li>
<li><em>fungus, bacteria, deep-sea life, plant communication</em></li>
<li><em>and horror movies</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to dedicate my remaining brainpower and ever-growing passion to the creators of <a href="https://bookdown.org/">Bookdown</a>, <em>probably the best free resource ever</em>.</p>
